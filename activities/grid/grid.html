            <p>In HTML, elements can be placed inside other elements, which creates a parent child relationship. The parent is the outer element, and the children are the elements inside it. This relationship is important when using Flexbox and Grid because these layout systems work on the parent container and control how the child elements are arranged inside it.</p>
            <p>The main differences between CSS Grid and Flexbox are that Grid is two dimensional, meaning it can arrange items in both rows and columns, while Flexbox is one dimensional and arranges items in a single row or a single column. Another difference is that Grid is better for making full page or complex layouts, while Flexbox is better for simpler, one direction layouts like menus or toolbars.</p>
