        <h2>My Answers</h2>
        <p>Hosting videos on YouTube has many good points. It is free, and your videos can reach a large audience because millions of people use YouTube every day. It also gives useful tools like analytics, captions, and easy sharing. However, there are also some negatives. YouTube shows ads, and sometimes you cannot control which ads appear. The platform also compresses videos, which can reduce quality.</p>
        <p>A transform is useful because it helps you change the size, position, or shape of something without changing what it is. A transform can move an object, rotate it, or make it bigger or smaller. This makes it easier to create animations, adjust layouts, or make things fit better on a page.</p>
        <p>The schedule for the rest of the class is open question about anything, we can ask about our final project too.</p>
