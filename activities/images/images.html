        <h2>My Answers</h2>
        <p><strong>What kind of photos are good to encode using JPEG?</strong><br>
            JPEG is best for real photos, like people, nature, or scenery, because it can show many colors and make the file smaller, though it loses a little quality.</p>
        <p><strong>What kind of photos are good to encode using GIF?</strong><br>
            GIF works well for simple images with few colors, such as icons, logos, or small graphics, and it is the only format that supports simple animations.</p>
        <p><strong>What is unique about the PNG format?</strong><br>
            PNG is special because it keeps the image sharp without losing quality and allows transparent backgrounds, which is very useful for logos or images that need to blend with the websites background.</p>
        <p><strong>How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?</strong><br>
            I resize a photo using photo software in windows before uploading it, so it matches the exact display dimensions.</p>
        <p><strong>Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS?</strong><br>
            Because CSS only changes how the picture looks on the screen but still loads the large file, which makes the website slower. Using editing software makes the image file truly smaller and helps the site load faster.</p>
