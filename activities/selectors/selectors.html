    <h2>Answer</h2>
        <p>List out the different ways to select an item: By tag name : Selects all tags p, h, elements. By id : Selects only one element with specific id, By class : Selects all elements with same class. By div : Selects all tag in one group.</p>
        <p>What is the difference between an ID and a Class? ID is used to uniquely identify one element on a webpage, while a class can be shared across many elements.</p>
        <p>What is the difference between a SPAN tag and a DIV tag? The span tag is an inline element, which means it is used for styling small parts of text or inline content without breaking the line. For example, changing the color of one word inside a sentence. The div tag is used to group larger sections of content.</p>
        <p>What is the difference between a DIV tag and a HEADER, MAIN, or FOOTER? The div tag is a general purpose container that has no special meaning, its mostly used to group content together and apply styles. In contrast, tags like header, main, and footer are carry meaning about the type of content inside them.</p>
        <p>What are the different ways to select a color? Sorry, I neer more explanation about it.</p>
