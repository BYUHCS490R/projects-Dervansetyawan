    <h1>Help</h1>
    <p>When we need help, we should first check lecture videos, and material posted on Canvas. If that does not solve the problem, we can ask the tutors during their lab hours, and we can ask questions in class too.</p>
    <p>Engagement assignments are due the same day at 11:59 PM after class. Late submissions are not accepted, and any assignment not turned in on time will receive a zero. Missing one results in a loss of points for that assignment.</p>
    <p>Projects are due at 05:00 AM on the assigned due date (Friday). Normally, late projects receive a zero. However, each student is given four resubmission opportunities during the semester. Resubmissions allow students to either submit a missed project up to one week late or improve a project for a better grade. These resubmissions must be used wisely since only four are available.</p>
