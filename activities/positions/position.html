            <li>What is the difference between block tags and inline tags?</li>
            <p>Block tags take up the full width and always start on a new line. Inline tags only take up as much space as they need and stay in the same line. Block tags stack vertically, while inline tags flow within text.</p>
            <li>What is the margin, border, and padding?</li>
            <p>Margin is the space outside the element. Border is the line around the element. Padding is the space inside the border, between the content and the border. Together, they control how much space an element uses.</p>
            <li>What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?</li>
            <p>CSS uses units to set sizes. Absolute units like px, cm, or in are fixed. Relative units like %, em, rem, vw, and vh change based on screen size or font size. Relative units are best for responsive design.</p>
            <li>When would you use a figure tag?</li>
            <p>Use the figure tag to group an image or media with a caption using figcaption. It helps connect the picture and its description, like a photo with a short note below it.</p>
