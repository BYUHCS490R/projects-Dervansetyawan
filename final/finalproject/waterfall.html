            <p>Tumpak Sewu Waterfall, located on the border of Lumajang and Malang in East Java, is often regarded as one of the most breathtaking waterfalls in Indonesia. Its name means “a thousand waterfalls,” referring to the way dozens of thin streams cascade down a semicircular cliff, creating an extraordinary curtain-like effect. Surrounded by lush greenery and dramatic valleys, Tumpak Sewu offers stunning viewpoints from above and an adventurous trek down to the base, where visitors can stand close to the powerful water flow and admire the towering cliffs. The area is also near scenic spots like Goa Tetes, adding to the overall experience for nature lovers and photographers. Although the journey to the bottom can be challenging and slippery, the incredible scenery makes it one of the most memorable natural attractions in East Java.</p>
