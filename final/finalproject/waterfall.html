                <h2>Why Tumpak Sewu Is Special</h2>
                <p>Tumpak Sewu, located on the border of Lumajang and Malang in East Java, is considered one of Indonesia’s most impressive waterfalls due to its unique semicircular shape and dramatic height. The water flows down through hundreds of narrow streams, creating a curtain-like effect that makes the landscape look surreal. The waterfall is fed by the Glidik River, which originates from Mount Semeru, the highest volcano in Java. The combination of steep cliffs, lush greenery, and constant mist creates a natural atmosphere that feels peaceful yet powerful. Many travelers regard Tumpak Sewu as one of the most beautiful waterfalls in Southeast Asia because of its rare geological structure and breathtaking panorama.</p>
                <h2>Best Things to Do</h2>
                <p>Visitors can explore several scenic spots around the waterfall. The panoramic viewpoint above the cliff offers a full view of the semicircle formation, making it the best location for photography. For a deeper experience, travelers often trek down to the base of the waterfall, passing bamboo ladders, rocks, and small streams. At the bottom, the sound of falling water and the cool mist create an unforgettable atmosphere. Some visitors continue their journey to nearby natural sites such as Goa Tetes, a cave with mineral-rich waterfalls that form beautiful rock patterns. Each part of the exploration brings a different perspective of the landscape, offering adventure, relaxation, and incredible visual experiences.</p>
                <h2>Travel Tips</h2>
                <p>Tumpak Sewu requires careful preparation because the terrain can be steep and slippery.

The path to the base includes ladders, river crossings, and rocky sections, so it is recommended to start early in the morning while the light is good and the weather is calm. Guides are available near the entrance for travelers who prefer extra safety. Since the area is environmentally sensitive, visitors should avoid leaving trash, stay on marked paths, and respect local regulations. By preparing properly and acting responsibly, visitors can enjoy Tumpak Sewu safely while helping preserve its natural beauty.</p>
