            <p>Pink Beach, also known as Pantai Merah, is a unique natural attraction located in Komodo National Park, East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. The beach gets its striking pink color from a mixture of white sand and tiny red coral fragments created by foraminifera, a type of microscopic organism found in the surrounding reefs. Visitors are drawn to its crystal-clear turquoise waters, vibrant coral reefs, and scenic hills that offer beautiful panoramic views. Pink Beach is ideal for swimming, snorkeling, relaxing on the sand, and enjoying the peaceful natural environment. It is accessible by boat from Labuan Bajo, often as part of a tour that includes other famous spots such as Komodo Island and Padar Island. As part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the area is protected, and visitors are encouraged to preserve its beauty by avoiding littering, respecting marine life, and using reef-safe sunscreen.</p>
