                <h2>Why the Sand is Pink</h2>
                <p>Pink Beach gets its unique pink color from a natural combination of soft white sand and tiny red coral particles created by microscopic organisms called foraminifera. When these organisms die, their red shells blend with the sand and form a gentle pink shade that becomes even more vibrant under sunlight. This rare phenomenon is one of the reasons Komodo National Park, the home of Pink Beach, is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its extraordinary marine life and remarkable natural beauty.</p>
                <h2>Best Things to Do</h2>
                <p>Pink Beach is an ideal place for both relaxation and adventure. The water is extremely clear, making it perfect for snorkeling among colorful coral reefs and tropical fish. Visitors can swim, relax on the pink shore, or take a peaceful walk along the coastline. A short hike to the nearby hill offers an incredible panoramic view of the pink sand and bright turquoise sea, making it a favorite spot for photography. The calm and protected environment allows visitors to enjoy nature in its purest form.</p>
                <h2>Travel Tips</h2>
                <p>Pink Beach is part of a protected UNESCO World Heritage Site, so visitors are encouraged to help preserve its natural environment. Using reef-safe sunscreen, avoiding contact with coral, and not taking sand as a souvenir are simple but important actions. Since the sun can be very strong, it is recommended to bring enough drinking water, a hat, and sunglasses. The beach is only accessible by boat, usually from Labuan Bajo, so planning your trip in advance is helpful. By following these tips, you can enjoy Pink Beach comfortably while supporting its long-term conservation.</p>
