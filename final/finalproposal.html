        <p>My website is titled “Beautiful Nature of Indonesia”. The topic of my site is Indonesia’s natural beauty and popular tourist places.</p>
        <p>I chose this topic because Indonesia has many amazing natural spots, such as beaches, mountains, national parks, islands, waterfalls, and lakes. Many people do not know how beautiful Indonesia is, and I want to show these places so more people can learn and visit.</p>
        <p>The home page will have a short welcome message, an introduction to Indonesia’s nature, a large photo, and a menu for the other pages. The five pages on my website will each focus on a type of natural place. The first page is about beaches, with pictures and short descriptions. The second page is about mountains and volcanoes. The third page is about national parks. The fourth page will show beautiful islands and marine life. The fifth page will focus on waterfalls and lakes.</p>
        <p>My form will collect the visitor’s name, email, country, favorite Indonesian nature spot, and comments. The table on the national parks page will include the name of the park, the province, and what we can see there.</p>
        <p>I will collect information from trusted tourism websites, government websites, and I will use free image and my photos to collect the photos that I want. Two references I plan to use are Wonderful Indonesia and Indonesia.go.id.</p>
        <P><strong>I have read the warning for this final project.</strong></P>
