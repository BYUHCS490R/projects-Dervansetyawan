            <p>Borobudur Temple is one of Indonesia's most famous landmarks, located in Central Java.
                Built in the 9th century during the Syailendra Dynasty, it is the world's largest Buddhist temple, featuring over 2,600 relief panels and 500 Buddha statues.
                The temple's design represents the Buddhist concept of the universe, guiding visitors from the earthly realm to enlightenment as they ascend its levels.</p>
            <p>Surrounded by lush green hills and overlooked by Mount Merapi, Borobudur is not only a masterpiece of architecture but also a symbol of Indonesia's rich cultural heritage.
                It serves as both a religious pilgrimage site and a major tourist attraction.
                Many visitors come early in the morning to witness the stunning sunrise over the ancient temple.</p>
