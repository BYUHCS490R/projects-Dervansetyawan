These days, we can listen to many different genres of music. Pop is a popular genre today because it is easy to listen to and it has simple pattrens, so many people enjoy it. We now have many platforms that we can use to listen to music and search for the music that we like.</p>
        <p>I liked music since I first learned to play piano. I really enjoyed hearing the sounds of the piano when I played. I like pop songs, and I often listen to popular pop music. Because of that, I tried making covers pop songs at that time. Until now, I still do that, and it has helped me improve my piano skill. Music makes me happy, and it puts me in a good mood whenever I listen to it. Music is a important part of my life.</p>
