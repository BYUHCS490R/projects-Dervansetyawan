        <h2>My Favorite Band</h2>
        <p>Lany is an American pop rock band from Los Angeles that was formed in 2014. The name Lany comes from combining the abbreviations LA (Los Angeles) and NY (New York). I like Lany because the rhythm in some of their songs makes me want to dance, and the lyrics are relatable, emotional, and easy to listen to, with a modern pop sound that feels fresh and personal. A few songs that i like are <em>"DNA"</em>, <em>"Dancing in the Kitchen"</em>, and <em>"Mean It".</em></p>
