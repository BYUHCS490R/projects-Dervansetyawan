        <p>I liked music since I first learned to play piano. I really enjoyed hearing the sounds of the piano when I played. I like pop songs, and I often listen to popular pop music. Because of that, I tried making covers pop songs at that time. Until now, I still do that, and it has helped me improve my piano skill. Music makes me happy, and it puts me in a good mood whenever I listen to it. Music is a important part of my life.</p>
